Secondary Accent Color: #4CAF50 (Green)
Button Color: #2196F3 (Blue)
Accent on Hover: #FFD54F (Light amber or yellow on hover)
This color scheme combines a dark background with bright, contrasting text and accent colors. It's a popular choice for media-related applications like movie databases because it provides a cinematic feel and emphasizes the content.

Remember that the choice of colors can be adjusted to match the style and branding you want for your application. You can also include some imagery, such as movie posters and film-related graphics, to enhance the visual appeal.


For a light mode theme for your Movie Database project, you can opt for a color scheme that offers a bright and clean look. Here's a suggested color theme for a light mode:

**Light Mode Theme:**
